                "One of the castle's most famous features is its four vaulted cellars, known as the Chillon Wine Cellars. These cellars were used to store goods during the castle's active years and are located in the lower levels of the castle. The cellars are composed of four interconnected vaulted chambers. The architecture is characterized by the use of sturdy stone construction and ribbed vaults, which are typical of medieval architecture. They were primarily used for storing wine, which was a valuable commodity back then, and the sellers provided a cool and dark environment, ideal for preserving the wine's quality.",
                "Today, the Chillon Wine Cellars have been transformed into a wine tasting area, allowing visitors to sample a variety of regional wines. The cellars offer a unique atmosphere with their vaulted ceiling and stone walls, creating a memorable setting for wine enthusiasts to enjoy a tasting experience."

                "Another important attraction of the Chillon Castle is its prison. The prison holds a significant place in its history and has captured the imagination of visitors, thanks in part to Lord Byron's poem: \"The Prisoner of Chillon.\" The prison served as a place of confinement, primarily used to hold political prisoners, enemies of the state, and individuals who were considered threats to the ruling authorities.",
                "The prison consists of several dungeons located in the lower levels of the castle. The cells were typically small, with thick stone walls, minimal light, and basic amenities, reflecting the harsh conditions prisoners had to endure. The most renowned prisoner associated with Chillon Castle is Fran√ßois Bonivard, who inspired Lord Byron's poem, published in 1816."
