                "The Chillon Castle, also known as Chateau de Chillon, is a medieval fortress located on the shores of Lake Geneva, in Montreux. It is one of the most visited castles in Switzerland and is known for its picturesque setting and rich history.",
                "The castle dates back to the 12th century and was originally built to control the strategic route along the lake. Over the centuries, it served as a fortress, a residence for the counts of Savoy, and even as a prison."

            "text": [
                "One of the castle's most famous features is its four vaulted cellars, known as the Chillon Wine Cellars. These cellars were used to store goods during the castle's active years and are located in the lower levels of the castle. The cellars are composed of four interconnected vaulted chambers. The architecture is characterized by the use of sturdy stone construction and ribbed vaults, which are typical of medieval architecture. They were primarily used for storing wine, which was a valuable commodity back then, and the sellers provided a cool and dark environment, ideal for preserving the wine's quality.",
                "Today, the Chillon Wine Cellars have been transformed into a wine tasting area, allowing visitors to sample a variety of regional wines. The cellars offer a unique atmosphere with their vaulted ceiling and stone walls, creating a memorable setting for wine enthusiasts to enjoy a tasting experience."

The prison holds a significant place in its history and has captured the imagination of visitors, thanks in part to Lord Byron's poem: \"The Prisoner of Chillon.\" The prison served as a place of confinement, primarily used to hold political prisoners, enemies of the state, and individuals who were considered threats to the ruling authorities.",
                "The prison consists of several dungeons located in the lower levels of the castle. The cells were typically small, with thick stone walls, minimal light, and basic amenities, reflecting the harsh conditions prisoners had to endure. The most renowned prisoner associated with Chillon Castle is Fran√ßois Bonivard, who inspired Lord Byron's poem, published in 1816."

The Forecourt is the outermost courtyard and serves as the entrance to the castle. It is accessible through a drawbridge and features a fortified gatehouse with defensive elements such as arrow slits. The Forecourt served as the first line of defense for the castle in the past. Beyond the Forecourt lies the Courtyard of Honor, also known as the Great Courtyard. This spacious area is surrounded by the castle's main buildings and was the heart of the fortress. It was used for various functions, including military operations, ceremonies, and gatherings of the castle's inhabitants."],

From these elevated walkways, one can appreciate the castle's layout and admire the surrounding views from different heights.",
                "The castle features also three formal great halls. The ones of greater significance are the Grand Hall and the council chamber. The Grand Hall, also referred to as the Great Hall, is one of the most impressive chambers in Chillon Castle. This vast room was used for official ceremonies, banquets, and receptions. Its high vaulted ceiling, adorned with intricate frescos and supported by massive columns, creates a grand ambiance. The hall offers stunning views of Lake Geneva through its large windows as well."

This room was used as a bedroom in the middle ages and probably served the same purpose in the Bernese era. The Bernese decoration, painted on a white background, and adorned with plants, fruits, and animals, dates back to the early 17th century.",
                "Another important attraction in Chillon Castle is its Chapel. The Chapel is the jewel of Chillon's architectural crown. The 14th-century paintings make it one of the rare religious buildings in the canton to have escaped the dissident zeal of the Reformation.",
                "Lastly, but not least important, is the weapons room. Situated almost at the exact center of Chillon's rocky island, the weapons room in the keep probably dates back to the 11th century. As both a refugee tower and a symbol of power, the keep was also used as a guard tower, provisional residence, storage, and more recently as a prison.",
