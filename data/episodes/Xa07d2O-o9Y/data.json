                "In the year 1420, there's a tale of a dragon rock descending from the heavens. Lake Pilatus might hold the resting place of the Roman governor Pontius Pilatus. According to legend, a petrified sentinel stands watch by a cave's entrance. Rising majestically to 2,128 meters, the Pilatus mountain massif captivates the mind without doubt.",
                "Even in contemporary times, Pilatus remains a realm of mystique, boasting natural wonders steeped in myth and legend. Accessible from Lucerne via gondola lift and aerial cable car, or from Alpnachstad via the world's steepest rack-railroad, Pilatus offers a journey ripe with enchantment."
