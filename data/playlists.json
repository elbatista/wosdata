It is composed of several peaks, of which the highest (2,128.5 m (6,983 ft)) is named Tomlishorn.\nThe top can also be reached with the Pilatus Railway, the world's steepest cogwheel railway, from Alpnachstad, operating from May to November (depending on snow conditions) and the whole year with the aerial panorama gondolas and aerial cableways from Kriens. Tomlishorn is located about 1.3 km (0.81 mi) to the southeast of the top cable car and cog railway station. Two other peaks, closer to the stations are called Esel (Donkey, 2,118 m [6,949 ft]), which lies just east over the railway station, the one on the west side is called Oberhaupt (Head-Leader, 2,105 m [6,906 ft]).\n\n♬ Music by Epidemic Sound\n\n#switzerland  #relaxing  #mountains  #luzern  #pilatus #travel #4k",
