      Inside the castle, you'll find a <strong>small museum</strong> showcasing the history of the Rhine Falls and the castle itself. Interactive displays, old artefacts, and audiovisual presentations bring the region’s past to life, from ancient settlements to the castle’s defensive role and its transformation into a tourism landmark.

      After exploring the museum, don't miss the <strong>panoramic glass lift</strong> that descends to the river level, giving spectacular views of the falls on the way down.
