    <h3 class="mt-5 text-2xl">👀 Panoramic Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      One of the highlights of visiting the Rhine Falls is walking out onto the <strong>panoramic viewing platforms</strong> that extend directly over the thundering water. These platforms are located on the <strong>Schloss Laufen (south bank) side</strong> and provide some of the most dramatic views of the falls.

      As you step onto each platform, the power of the falls becomes almost overwhelming. The spray rises up, the roar is deafening, and you feel the ground slightly vibrating under your feet. It’s an immersive experience that lets you see the waterfall from above, the side, and almost directly in front.
