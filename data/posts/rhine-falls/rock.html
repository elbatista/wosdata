    <p>
      One of the most thrilling experiences at the Rhine Falls is taking a boat to the <strong>large rock island</strong> right in the middle of the rushing water. From the north bank, you can board the <a href="https://rhyfall-maendli.ch/en/boat-tours-experiences/rock-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[var(--red)] cursor-pointer hover:underline">Yellow Boat Rock Tour</a> which brings you directly to the rock.

      After docking, you’ll climb a steep but safe staircase up to the summit platform. The view from the top is breathtaking – you’re completely surrounded by the thundering falls on both sides, feeling the cool spray and the vibrating power beneath your feet.

      ✅ <strong>Access info:</strong><br>
      - Only accessible via the Yellow Boat from the north bank.<br>
      - The climb is short (~5 minutes) but steep with metal steps.<br>
      - Highly recommended in summer when the falls are at their fullest.
